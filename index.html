    <h1 class="glow">Our Journey Through <span>2025</span></h1>
    <p>
        A year not measured in months, but in curiosity, confusion,
        late-night questions, broken logic, rebuilt understanding,
        anime arcs, calculus battles, and ideas that refused to stay small.

    <h2>Where It Started</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>January — Chaos Meets Curiosity</h3>
            <p>
                You arrived with one sentence energy: “Teach me everything.”
                No filters. No ego. Just raw curiosity colliding with reality.
                Mathematics felt hostile. Concepts felt abstract.
                But the hunger to understand was loud.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Engineering Mode Activated</h3>
            <p>
                B.Tech CST pressure. Finals approaching faster than logic.
                We broke topics down to atoms — prepositions, SQ3R,
                programming constructs, CGPA calculations —
                until confusion lost its power.
            </p>

    <h2>The Academic Arc</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Calculus Battles</h3>
            <p>
                Differentiation. Chain rule with too many functions.
                Rolle’s theorem.
                Problems solved slowly, then faster,
                until symbols stopped looking like ancient curses.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Linear Algebra Awakening</h3>
            <p>
                LI vs LD. Basis. Dimension.
                Tricks for MCQs.
                Suddenly vectors weren’t random arrows —
                they were structure hiding in space.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Revision Nights</h3>
            <p>
                “Tomorrow is exam day.”
                Speed learning mode engaged.
                Full units compressed into clarity.
                Not magic — just understanding stacked properly.

    <h2>Projects & Creation</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Web Development Era</h3>
            <p>
                From “How do I publish a website?” to
                structured frontend–backend thinking.
                Hosting, UI logic, clean structure,
                and finally understanding what the internet actually runs on.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>The Affiliate System Blueprint</h3>
            <p>
                A serious idea:
                custom college affiliate recruitment system.
                Authentication, dashboards, databases,
                validation flaws exposed and fixed —
                thinking like a real engineer, not just a coder.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>The Absurd Bottle Store</h3>
            <p>
                A collection, not a marketplace.
                Headless architecture.
                Educational absurdity disguised as design.
                Proof that creativity and engineering
                are not enemies.

    <div class="timeline">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Anime Discussions</h3>
            <p>
                Demon Slayer watch orders.
                Infinity Castle anticipation.
                Primordial demons.
                Noir — not just a word,
                but a vibe.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Reality Questions</h3>
            <p>
                Patterns beneath the world.
                Why systems behave the way they do.
                When curiosity drifted toward philosophy,
                science quietly followed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Hostel Wi-Fi Struggles</h3>
            <p>
                The universal enemy.
                Disconnects under load.
                Networking theory learned through suffering.

    <h2>What 2025 Really Was</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Not Just Learning</h3>
            <p>
                2025 wasn’t about memorizing.
                It was about replacing fear with structure,
                confusion with models,
                and randomness with reasoning.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>A Mind Under Construction</h3>
            <p>
                From “I know nothing” to
                “I know how to figure it out.”
                That shift is permanent.
